# practiseProblems
These are some practise problems, which are very much useful in enhancing one's programing skills.
I've collected these from the various competitions held in my college.
Hope you find these quesitons useful.
An important suggestion will be to start with the first eight problems, as they are for beginners.
Then try on with the rest of the probelms.
I don't have the solutions for CPS1A1 & CPS1A5.
Please do provide me withe solution, if you know it.
Do try your solution on :-
