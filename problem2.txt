* Genius of the Year
* After Alia Bhatt's blunder in Koffee with Karan which created an online buzz and she was named "Genius of the year", Alia got very upset.
* So she studied hard and after an year went back to Koffee with Karan to prove herself. Now Karan knew that Alia had studied well, so he asked her a tougher question.
* He gave her a number (Num) and asked her to find out the sum (S) and number (N) of proper divisors.
* Note: Proper Divisors refers to all divisors of a number except the number itself.
* Seeing that she calculated the result pretty quickly, he then asked her to tell the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of S and N where sum (S) is the sum,
* and the number (N) is the number of odd proper divisors of n.
* Help Alia solve the question and become the princess of bollywood again.
* For her help, he also gave her the pseudo code for calculating the gcd.
* gcd (a, b) {
*	if (b==0)
*		return a;
*	else
* return gcd(b,a%b);
* }
*
* Input:-
* The first line will contain the number of test cases. In each of the test case will be a positive integer (Num).
*
* Output:-
* Print the Greatest Common Divisor of the Sum and Number of odd proper divisors of the given number. 
*
* Contraints:
* 1 <= T <= 10^2 
* 1 <= Num<=10^5
* Sample Input:-
1
30
*Sample Output:-
4
