* Naruto loves Sakura Chan
* Sakura is a very Charming and Sweet girl in Leaf Village and she has the following task for Naruto. 
* You are given N numbers you need to find the number of occurrence of each distinct number in the list.
* Print each distinct number sorted in ascending order followed by its count separated by space.Each distinct number and its occurrence must be printed in a new line.
*
* Input:-
* First line of input contains N i.e number of numbers in the list. Followed by N numbers of the list in a single line.
*
* Output:-
* In each line of output print 2 numbers the distinct number followed by its respective count.
*
* Constraint:-
* 1 <= N <= 100000.
* 0 <= Value of each element in the list <= 100000
*
* Sample Input:-
5
1 2 3 2 4
* Sample Output:-
1 1
2 2
3 1
4 1
*
* Explanation
* Explanation Example 1 : There are 4 distinct numbers 1,2,3,4. Number of occurrences of which are 1,2,1,1 respectively. So we get the above output for the 1st Example
* Note : The numbers should be output in sorted order means Distinct number which is smaller in value must be printed first and its respective count must follow thereafter separated by space.
* Thereafter the larger distinct numbers must follow with their count(till there exists a distinct number) .
