/* *
* Sasuke - A Perfect Competitor
* Sasuke is the brightest student in the class. He likes to play with ranges.
* Naruto, on other hand, jealous of Sasuke always looks for ways to challenge him with daunting problems. So he comes up with an interesting problem, called “CP Numbers”.
* He gives Sasuke a number N. Sasuke needs to print all those numbers which are perfect cubes and less than equal to N. Sasuke is confident since he believes that this is a trivial question.
* But then, Naruto adds more details to the question. Sasuke also needs to print the number of distinct prime divisors of the printed numbers.
* The range of these numbers is vast. You are his best friend. Help Sasuke prove his intelligence one more time. 
*
* Input:-
* The input will consist of 'T' testcases. T lines follow consisting of an positive integer N. 
*
* Output:-
* The output should contain the numbers which are cubes in separate lines followed by count of their prime divisors. Output -1 if no answer exists . 
* Contraints: 
* 1 <= T <= 500 
* 2 <= N <= 10^5
*
* Sample Input
* 1
* 100
*
* Sample Output
* 8 1
* 27 1
* 64 1
