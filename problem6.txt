/* *
* Right Angled Triangle
* Lets have a warmup question for trihacker coding event.... I'm going to keep the problem statement straight forward. In a right angled triangle ABC right angled at B D is the midpoint of AC.
* Given lengths AB and BC, find the angle DBC. Output should be the smallest integer not less than the angle DBC
* For Example: If the angle DBC is 45.0000 print 45 and if it is is 45.7832 print 46
*
* Input:-
* First line contains two numbers which are the lengths of AB and BC.
*
* Output:-
* Print the required answer.
*
* Constraints: 1 <= AB, BC<=100
* Hint:- 
* Some Maths Library functions :-
* sin(x) = sine value of x , similarly for cos and tan .
* asin(x ) = inverse sin of x , similarly for cos and tan.
* ceil(x) = smallest integer function
* floor(x) = greatest integer function.
*
* Sample Input:-
30 30
* Sample Output:-
45
