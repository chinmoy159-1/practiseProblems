* Chunin Exams - A Step to becoming Hokage
* Naruto is in middle of Chunin Exams. His dream of becoming a Hokage can be one step closer if he passes the exam. However this time problem setter Ibiki, the master of interrogation.
* He has used his old trick to fail as many students as he can. Naruto doesnt wanna fail but he can't cheat either. Can you help him clear the test ?
* Ibiki has a beautiful array of size N. He wants Naruto to find the middle element of the array after rotating the element by K positions i.e from left towards right for each query. 
* Rotate by 1 step means that the element from end of array move to the beginning and all the other elements keep on moving towards right.
* But there are multiple queries, you have to output the middle element after each query. The array regains its original form (initial state) after each query.
* So we do not consider the changed array but the original array in each query.
*
* Input:-
* First line of input contains number of numbers of array N. The next line contains N space separated elements of array A. Then there an number Q denoting the number of queries.
* Next Q lines lines contain a single number K denoting the value by which the elements of an array are shifted. 
*
* Output:-
* For each Query output the middle element when the elements of the array are shifted by K positions. 
*
* Constraints:-
* 1 <= N <= 100
* 0 <= A[i] <= 10^9
* 1 <= Q <= 10
* 1 <= Shift Value (k) < 10
* Note : The number of elements are always odd.
*
* Sample Input:-
5
2 4 3 7 5

* Sample Output:-
4
